Oh take a look in the mirror you so sad
It's so cold like the winter market we used to go
I don't cry any more but i feel so hard
So i don't need you too close to me
If you don't need me and so i said
I don't know why what is happen in yesterday

To stay with you, always you are the world to me and dreaming on
you can take my sword for you

Oh how do you feel? So fine, you are the world to me and dream on
You stole my heart so long ago.

Oh i release my souls to you feel my song..
